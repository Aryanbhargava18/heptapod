Literature tools: find a paper, then get its text in a form worth reading.

  **Find it.**  ArxivSearchTool searches arXiv (ids, PDF links, abstracts).
                The INSPIRE bundle covers HEP metadata and citations, and has
                no arXiv access or retrieval of its own.

  **Read it.**  ArxivSourceTool fetches the LaTeX e-print, which is the best
                input for reading a paper's equations because they survive
                intact. Where arXiv has no source, PDFToTeXTool reconstructs
                TeX-faithful text from the PDF instead -- symbols,
                sub/superscripts, fractions and radicals come back as TeX
                macros rather than being flattened into characters that no
                longer say what they meant. ArxivPDFTool retrieves the
                PDF that tool reads.

  **Where.**    Everything retrieved for one paper lands together in
                <output_dir>/<arxiv_id>/ -- the PDF, the extracted source
                tree, and the normalized LaTeX -- so a corpus is one
                directory per paper.

IMPORT COST. The arXiv tools need only `requests`, which is a base
dependency; the PDF path needs pypdfium2, the literature bundle's one pip
dep. tex_extract imports pypdfium2 at module scope, so importing it eagerly
here made `import tools.literature` -- and with it every arXiv tool -- fail
outright on a base install, for a dependency those tools never touch.

The PDF names are therefore resolved LAZILY (PEP 562). On a base install the
package imports, the arXiv tools work, and PDFToTeXTool still resolves (it
imports pypdfium2 inside the method that needs it, so only CALLING it fails);
pdf_to_tex and page_to_tex raise ModuleNotFoundError on first access, naming
what to install. The failure is scoped to the thing that actually needs the
dependency.
