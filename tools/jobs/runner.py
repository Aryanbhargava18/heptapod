Detached job runner: ``python -m tools.jobs.runner <job_dir>``.

Reads spec.json, runs the whitelisted tool, writes result.json and drives
status.json through running -> done | failed | cancelled. Never trusts
module/class strings from the (user-writable) spec — the tool class is
re-resolved from the in-code WHITELIST. stdout/stderr already point at log.txt
(the submitter wired them), so plain prints and tracebacks land there.

Stopping a job. The submitter starts the runner in its own session, so the
runner leads a process group holding everything the tool starts: MG5 and its
madevent workers, a wolframscript kernel, Delphes. Both ways a job is stopped
send SIGTERM to that whole group:

  * the ``max_seconds`` watchdog, from a thread in this process;
  * ``canceljob``, from the MCP server.

The runner's own SIGTERM handler raises ``JobTerminated`` in the main thread.
It derives from BaseException so the tools' ``except Exception`` blocks let it
through, and subprocess.run / communicate kill their child on the way out.
The runner then records the outcome and SIGKILLs whatever is left of the group.

Progress. The runner installs itself as the tool's ``_stream_callback``, so a
tool's ``report_progress(...)`` calls (tools/jobs/progress.py) land in
status.json, throttled, where jobstatus renders them as a progress bar.
