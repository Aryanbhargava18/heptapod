FeynRules model tools.

FeynRulesToUFOTool compiles a ``.fr`` model to a UFO directory.
ValidateLagrangianTool runs the same FeynRules consistency checks without
writing a UFO, which is the faster loop while a model is still being edited --
``WriteUFO`` is the expensive half.

Both drive ``UFO_generator.wl`` through wolframscript and share
:func:`_invoke_generator`.  Neither assumes anything about the model: the
Lagrangian expression and whether to load the Standard Model alongside the
model file are both caller-supplied, because a wrong guess at either produces a
UFO that is silently wrong rather than one that fails.

    some define only the pieces, so pass whatever sums to the full Lagrangian --
    including the SM part if you loaded it.

    The UFO is emitted as Python 2. FeynRules 2.3.49 writes `raise UFOError,
    "..."` and similar, so `object_library.py` will not parse under Python 3 and
    a script that reads the model by importing it will fail. Read it statically
    instead -- tools/ufo parses particles and vertices with `ast` for exactly
    this reason -- or let MadGraph convert it, which it does on first import.

    Success means a complete UFO exists, not that Mathematica exited cleanly:
    WriteUFO writes its boilerplate even when vertex extraction produced
    nothing, so the output is checked for the files that carry the physics.
