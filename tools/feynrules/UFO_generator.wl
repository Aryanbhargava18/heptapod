        ModelPath=<PATH_TO_MODEL.fr> \

   Nothing about the model is assumed.  The Lagrangian expression is supplied
   by the caller rather than guessed from a naming convention, and whether the
   Standard Model is loaded alongside the model file is a separate decision
   from what that expression contains -- a pure dark sector needs neither.
   Omit Lagrangian entirely and the script loads the model, reports the
   Lagrangian-like symbols it actually defines, and exits; discovering the
   name is cheaper than guessing it wrong.

   Exit codes:
     0  success
     1  bad invocation, unusable environment, or undefined Lagrangian symbol
     2  WriteUFO reported success but produced an incomplete UFO
     3  a consistency check failed and StrictChecks=true

(* ExpandIndices BEFORE WriteUFO, and by default.

   WriteUFO given a Lagrangian that still carries unexpanded SU(2) index
   structure emits `P.<>CreateObjectParticleName[PartNameMG[Wi]]` for the
   gauge self-couplings -- Mathematica source where a Python particle name
   belongs. Those vertex blocks are then unparseable, and every tool that
   reads the UFO simply does not see them. The model compiles, reports
   success, and is missing its triple- and quartic-gauge couplings.

   Measured on the published Hidden Abelian Higgs implementation: compiled
   straight, 0 Zp-W-W vertices; compiled as ExpandIndices[LHAHM], 105
   vertices including 4 Zp-W-W. The loss is silent in both the tool's own
   postflight and in MadGraph, which just sees a smaller model.

   FeynmanRules expands Wi correctly on its own, so the defect is in WriteUFO
   re-processing the Lagrangian rather than in the index expansion. Expanding
   first sidesteps it. On a Lagrangian that is already expanded -- which
   SM.fr's own pieces are, since they call ExpandIndices internally -- this is
   redundant rather than harmful, which is why it is safe as a default.

   Set ExpandIndices=false to skip it, for a model where the expansion is too
   expensive or the caller has already done it in their own expression. *)

   ghost sector that shows up as tens of extra vertices. One model built this
   way carried 138 gauge-artefact vertices against 122 physical ones and its
   author only discovered the gauge afterwards. Nothing in FeynRules announces

   with nothing in any output to show it -- an agent noted that passing a

   passing the right one. Term count is after expansion, so "LSM + LBSM"

(* Unphysical fields that survived expansion.

   THE SILENT FAILURE this catches. An add-on re-expresses an SM gauge
   eigenstate by adding a rule to MR$Definitions. If the pattern does not match
   what FeynRules actually stored -- and it often does not, because each rule is
   kept twice, bare (Phi[2]) and index-wrapped (Phi[Index[SU2D,2]]) -- the rule
   is simply never applied. The unphysical field stays in the expanded
   Lagrangian, vertex extraction drops every term containing it, and nothing
   anywhere says so. One model lost its entire |D Phi_SM|^2 term this way,
   along with the W and Z masses and every SM Higgs coupling, and still
   compiled and passed hermiticity. The author spent forty minutes finding it.

   The class list is read through MR$ClassesList / MR$ClassesRules, which is
   the API FeynRules 2.3.49 actually exposes. An earlier version used
   MR$ClassNameList -- a symbol that appears in Core/Loop.m but is never
   defined at top level, so it stayed an inert symbol, Select returned
   unevaluated, ListQ was False, and the whole diagnostic emitted NOTHING while
   looking like it had run. Verified against a live kernel: for the SM the
   unphysical classes are {B, Wi, ghB, ghWi, LL, lR, QL, uR, dR, Phi, theta,
   eps0..eps9}, LSM leaves none of them behind, and LSM + Phibar[1] Phi[1]
   reports {Phi}.

   Wrapped defensively: a FeynRules version that shapes these differently must
   not take a run down over a diagnostic. *)

   InputForm, not the default. ToString on a machine real renders six

   numerical comparison discarding the comparison. FeynRules' own tolerance is
