Where an external tool's path comes from.

`config.py` is per-clone and gitignored, so a fresh checkout has only
`config.example.py` and its placeholders -- and a test suite that reads
`config.py` directly reports "not configured" on every machine but the one
where somebody filled it in. Meanwhile toolbase already stores exactly these
paths for the same toolkit, set once with `tb config set heptapod
feynrules_path ...`, and keeps them out of the repository by construction.

So paths resolve through a chain rather than a file:

    1. environment    FEYNRULES_PATH, WOLFRAMSCRIPT_PATH, MG5_PATH.
                      CI sets these; they override everything.
    2. config.py      a real value, i.e. anything that is not the
                      placeholder `config.example.py` ships.
    3. toolbase       the effective config for this toolkit, project scope
                      over user scope, exactly as `tb serve` resolves it.
    4. None           unresolvable. A caller decides whether that is a skip
                      or an error; this module does not.

Nothing here raises on a missing toolbase: the toolkit has to work for
someone who cloned it and never installed one.
